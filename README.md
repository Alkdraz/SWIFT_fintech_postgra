Thesis Topic: Innovative Research to the Impact of Sentiment Analysis on Stock Forecasting Model
Abstract: Combining the real-time datasets and theoretical research, the paper explores the influence of structured emotional data on stock forecasting model.  
          Utilizing Pandas to preprocess the given data (data loading, cleaning and preparation, regularization, time series processing, data aggregation, etc.).  
          With the help of natural language tool kit (NLTK) and Loughran McDonald (LM) financial thesaurus, the research conducts the emotional analysis on unstructured
          text information and integrates the obtained structured data into the stock with historical price before analyzing the correlation of each stock index to 
          reduce the dimension of data.  Based on the algorithm of recurrent neural network and the relevant derivative algorithm and the error evaluation method 
          to the research, some hypotheses were proposed and verified in procedure, so that the experiment can ultimately predict the closing price of the stock with 
          the effect of sentiment data.  Compared with peer researches, the highlights of the experiment are reflected in two aspects which are the multi-dimensional 
          data acquisition and the optimized neural network super parametersâ€™ adjustment respectively.  Finally, when the training samples are sufficient, 
          the emotional feature data is incorporated to increase the prediction accuracy appropriately.
